## Code overview

All code files are in ```./src/```.

Files with "utilities":
- ``haar_scattering_transform.py`` has an implementation of a class that ... computes the Haar Scattering Transform !
It is supposed to be clear from the docstrings, but in summary: we instantiate it with an ``igraph`` object representing
the structure of the domain where the signal lives (so that the pairings to pass from layer j to layer j+1 are computed
during initialization), and it has a method ``get_haar_scattering_transform`` that receives a (flattened) signal living
in that (graph) domain and computes its scalar or boolean Haar Scattering Transform, depending on the dtype of the input
(this is automatically detected).
- ``matching.py`` calls [blossalg](https://github.com/nenb/blossalg) methods that help us matching "nodes" in the Haar 
Scattering Transform. The package ``blossalg`` goal is to implement the Blossom Algorithm and it is still very young, 
but it works for this project. Install it at your own risk ! 
- ``unstructured2graphs.py`` has some utilities to build the domain graph for image grids and periodic time series, and 
to convert corresponding signals to the right format.
- ``read_MNIST.py`` reads the MNIST that we should be able to find under ``./data/``.
- ``read_ECG5000.py`` reads the ECG5000 data set we should be able to find under `./data/``.
